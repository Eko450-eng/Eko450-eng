# Ekrem Atmaca

Hi my name is Ekrem Atmaca, you can call me Eko for short. I'm a web developer living in Baden WÃ¼rrtemberg in Germany
I became fascinated with programming when I was 12 years old and tried to code my first own modification for a game called Minecraft. From there on my passion for programming grew bigger by the day. I love learning new stuff especially new ways to code more efficent and of course cooler programms and websites
